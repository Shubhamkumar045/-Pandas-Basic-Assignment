    "Answer--\n",
    "Pandas provides a variety of functions for data manipulation in DataFrames. Here are some common functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "A)-- head() and tail(): These functions allow you to view the first or last n rows of a DataFrame.\n",
    "df.head()  # View the first 5 rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "df.tail(10)  # View the last 10 rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "B)--info(): This function provides a concise summary of a DataFrame, including the data types, non-null values, and memory usage.\n",
    "df.info()\n",
    "C)--describe(): It generates descriptive statistics of the DataFrame, including measures of central tendency, \n",
    "dispersion, and shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "df.describe()\n",
    "D)--shape: Returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the DataFrame (rows, columns).\n",
    "df.shape\n",
    "E)--sort_values(): Sorts the DataFrame by one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "df.sort_values(by='Age', ascending=False)\n",
    "F)--groupby(): Groups the DataFrame by one or more columns and allows you to perform aggregate functions on the grouped data.\n",
    "df.groupby('Gender')['Age'].mean()\n",
    "G)--drop(): Removes specified rows or columns from the DataFrame.\n",
    "df.drop(index=[0, 1], columns='Gender')\n",
    "H)--fillna(): Fills missing values in the DataFrame with a specified value or a value derived from the DataFrame.\n",
    "df.fillna(0)  # Fills NaN values with 0\n",
    "I)--apply(): Applies a function along the axis of the DataFrame.\n",
    "df['Age'] = df['Age'].apply(lambda x: x + 1)  # Increment the age of each person by 1\n",
    "\n",
